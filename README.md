# solana-validator-failover

This PL Systems fork is `0.1.22-pl.2`, based on upstream `v0.1.22`, commit
[`613764b50c1282a0274cde11c79ec3c3d593e433`](https://github.com/SOL-Strategies/solana-validator-failover/commit/613764b50c1282a0274cde11c79ec3c3d593e433).
It supports Agave/Salsa and full Firedancer/Samba with wire protocol **4**.
Both participants must run this protocol; older peers fail before identity changes.

## Native and mixed-client handover

Configure `validator.client` as `agave` (default) or `firedancer`. Native clients
also require `validator.firedancer_config` and `validator.vote_account`. Configure
the same vote-account public key on both participants in any native pair:

```yaml
validator:
  client: firedancer
  bin: /opt/harmonic-samba/v26.09.4-harmonic/bin/firedancer
  firedancer_config: /etc/samba/validator.toml
  vote_account: YOUR_VOTE_ACCOUNT_PUBLIC_KEY
  cluster: mainnet-beta
  cluster_rpc_url: https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
  failover:
    max_slot_lag: 32
    rollback:
      enabled: false
    tls:
      enabled: true
      # Supply this node's existing CA/certificate/key paths below.
```

This is a partial profile; retain identities, local RPC, peers and TLS paths
from the complete configuration below. Replace the illustrated vote account
for your validator. Native identity-command defaults use `set-identity --config`
and omit Agave's ledger/tower flags. Existing command templates remain supported.
Do not override native commands with the Agave templates in the example below.
Native ledger/tower paths are ignored and no dummy tower is required.

Every transfer requires an explicit source-demoted acknowledgement. If either
participant is native, both must use mTLS and advertise the same vote account.
After demotion, the source answers a fresh identity/health/head challenge. The
destination rechecks its identity, health and head; both genesis hashes and the
epoch-effective vote authority are checked using the independent RPC. Authority
is rechecked before promotion. Native mode requires the effective voter to equal
the active identity, matching the identity-only signer profile.

Native and mixed-client handovers proceed immediately after these checks. There
is no slot/finalization delay or external leader-window wait. The validator's own
identity command may still drain current work. This is an explicit departure
from the pinned [Firedancer tower warning](https://github.com/harmonic/samba/blob/eed6c122a9756fc1f6e5021a636a3d6961a76952/src/discof/tower/fd_tower_tile.c#L1733)
to wait 512 slots when changing identity without importing a compatible tower;
immediate handover does not provide that lockout-expiry protection.

A compatible Agave-only pair still transfers a verified tower after demotion.
For native pairs, no tower is transferred. An Agave destination archives its
stale tower only after source demotion and fresh checks, then promotes without
`--require-tower`.
Native paths are never touched. The same procedure supports the reverse direction.

**Service coordination is required.** The outer controller must hold each
node's shared transition lock for the full transaction, quiesce the updater
before HA, and keep a durable activation inhibit after any failed or ambiguous
outcome. Every other activation path must honor that lock and inhibit. Fresh
RPC proofs do not replace this protection against another local controller.
Restore automation only after both participants exit successfully and their
live identities are verified. This binary does not stop systemd services itself.

Automatic rollback is rejected. A promotion error or lost connection exits
nonzero and never reactivates the old signer. Inspect both live identities before
recovery; when reversing a completed transfer, run a new handover with the roles
reversed. Dry runs perform readiness/protocol checks but skip identity commands,
all hooks and tower writes.

Protocol completion verifies identities, health and head, then requires the
configured vote account's independent `lastVote` to advance strictly beyond the
post-demotion processed-slot anchor, with a 60-second deadline and repeated local
checks. This observes voting after promotion; it does not delay activation.
Stale votes cannot complete the transaction.
The peer acknowledgement follows this verification; failure leaves automation
inhibited and never reactivates the old signer. Legacy Agave configurations without
`vote_account` explicitly report identity-only verification. Leader behavior
remains a separate observation. The previous advisory credit-rank polling is
replaced by this vote-progress check; its old configuration keys remain accepted.

Simple p2p Solana validator failovers. This tool helps automate **planned** failovers. To automate **unexpected** failovers see [solana-validator-ha](https://github.com/SOL-Strategies/solana-validator-ha).

![solana-validator-failover](docs/failover.png)

A QUIC-based program that orchestrates safe, fast failovers between Solana validators. [This post](https://solstrategies.io/blog/quic-solana-validator-failovers) covers the background in more detail. In summary, it coordinates three steps across both nodes:

1. Source switches passive and positively acknowledges demotion.
2. Source proves it remains passive; compatible Agave pairs also transfer a tower.
3. Destination promotes, verifies its live state and completes the acknowledgement exchange.

Convenience safety checks, bells, and whistles:

- Check and wait for validator health before failing over
- Optionally wait for a gap in the leader schedule for Agave-only transfers
- Fresh identity, health, slot, genesis and vote-authority checks
- Pre/post failover hooks
- Customizable validator client and set identity commands to support (most) any validator client

## How it works

Running `solana-validator-failover run` on either node **automatically detects the node's role** (active or passive) from its local RPC identity:

- **Passive node** → starts a QUIC server, waits for the active node to connect
- **Active node** → connects to the passive peer as a QUIC client and orchestrates the handover

**You run the command on both nodes.** Start the passive node first so it is listening when the active node connects.

![solana-validator-failover passive-to-active](docs/failover-passive-to-active.gif)

![solana-validator-failover active-to-passive](docs/failover-active-to-passive.gif)

## Usage

```shell
# 1. Run on the passive node first — starts a server waiting for the active node
solana-validator-failover run --not-a-drill

# 2. Run on the active node — connects to the passive peer and initiates the handover
solana-validator-failover run
```

By default, `run` executes in **dry-run mode**: readiness and the authenticated protocol are checked, but identity commands, hooks and tower writes are skipped. Pass `--not-a-drill` on the **passive** node to execute for real.

> ⚠️ **Who you run this as matters.** The user must have:
> - Permission to run set-identity commands for the validator
> - Read/write permission on Agave tower files for a real compatible transfer; native clients do not use them

### Flags

#### `run` flags

| Flag                           | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--not-a-drill`                | `false` | Execute failover for real. Effective on the passive node; ignored on the active node.                                                                             |
| `--no-wait-for-healthy`        | `false` | Skip waiting for the node to report healthy at `<rpc_address>/health`.                                                                                            |
| `--no-min-time-to-leader-slot` | `false` | Skip the optional leader-window wait for Agave-only transfers. Native/mixed transfers always skip this wait. |
| `--skip-tower-sync`            | `false` | Deprecated: native handovers skip tower transfer automatically; rejected for Agave-only pairs. |
| `-y, --yes`                    | `false` | Skip all interactive confirmation prompts.                                                                                                                        |
| `--to-peer <name\|ip>`         | —       | When run on the active node, auto-select a peer by its configured name or IP address, skipping the interactive selector. Ignored on the passive node.             |

#### Persistent flags

| Flag                      | Default                                                      | Description                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `-c, --config <path>`     | `~/solana-validator-failover/solana-validator-failover.yaml` | Path to config file.                          |
| `-l, --log-level <level>` | —                                                            | Override `log.level` (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`). |
| `-n, --no-update-check`   | `false`                                                      | Skip the startup update check. Overrides `update.check_on_startup` in the config file. |

### Peer selection

The active node **always prompts you to select a peer**, even when only one is configured. Use `--to-peer <name|ip>` to skip the prompt — useful for scripted or non-interactive failovers:

```shell
# Skip peer selection prompt by name
solana-validator-failover run --to-peer backup-validator-region-x

# Fully non-interactive (skip peer selection and all confirmation prompts)
solana-validator-failover run --to-peer backup-validator-region-x --yes
```

## Installation

### Download binary

Build this fork from the pinned source revision. Upstream release binaries do not contain the protocol-4 native handover changes.

### From source

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/plsystems-dev/solana-validator-failover.git
   cd solana-validator-failover
   ```

2. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   make build
   # or manually:
   go build -o bin/solana-validator-failover .
   ```

3. **Copy the binary to where you need it:**
   ```bash
   cp ./bin/solana-validator-failover /usr/local/bin/solana-validator-failover
   ```

## Prerequisites

1. **A (preferably private) low-latency UDP route** between active and passive validators. Latency varies across setups, so YMMV, though QUIC should give a good head start.

2. **Some focus and appreciation of what you're doing** — these can be high pucker factor operations regardless of tooling.

3. **Suitable local and independent RPC endpoints** — use `--full-rpc-api` for Agave. Native Firedancer uses its TOML RPC configuration; do not pass Agave flags to it. For resilient peer discovery, configure a private cluster RPC that also supports `getClusterNodes`; it is used when the local validator's gossip view does not contain the peer.

## Configuration

```yaml
# default --config=~/solana-validator-failover/solana-validator-failover.yaml
log:
  # minimum log level; overridden by --log-level when explicitly supplied

  cluster: mainnet-beta

  # (required for custom clusters) RPC URL for the cluster.

    # The fenced protocol rejects automatic rollback. Use an explicit reverse handover.
    rollback:
      enabled: false

# update check configuration
update:
  # check for a new release on startup and print a warning if one is available
  # default: true
  # override with the --no-update-check CLI flag
  check_on_startup: true
```

## Rollback

Keep `failover.rollback.enabled: false`. A failed command can have an ambiguous
outcome; reactivating the source before proving destination fencing can create
two signers. The fork reports failure and leaves recovery to the controller or
operator. A normal reverse handover applies the same source acknowledgement and
fresh checks with the participants' current roles.

## Troubleshooting gossip peer discovery

`svf` determines this node's role from the local validator RPC. When looking for the active peer by pubkey, it checks the local RPC first and then `validator.cluster_rpc_url`. This matters because `getClusterNodes` represents the responding validator's own in-memory gossip/CRDS view; it can differ from the independent view collected by `solana gossip`, especially in mixed-client Agave/Firedancer deployments.

To inspect exactly what the local RPC reports:

```shell
PK=<active_identity_pubkey>
RPC=http://127.0.0.1:8899

curl -sS "$RPC" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"getClusterNodes"}' |
  jq --arg pk "$PK" '{error, count:(.result | length), match:[.result[] | select(.pubkey == $pk)]}'
```

If `match` is empty locally while `solana gossip` shows the peer, configure a trusted private `cluster_rpc_url` that exposes `getClusterNodes`. `svf` still fails closed if neither RPC view contains the expected active pubkey.
